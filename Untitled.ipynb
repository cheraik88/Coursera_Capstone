    "In this project, our main objective is to look for an optimal location to open a Chinese restaurant. Main target audiences are aspiring chefs or business owners who are looking to open a Chinese restaurant in the city of Toronto.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key considerations when deciding to open a restaurant is to firstly identify a location which is not overly crowded with existing restaurants as it means that competition will be greater. Specifically, the ideal location should have minimal or close to zero existing Chinese restaurants to minimize competition. Besides competition, the ideal location should also be in an area which is bustling with a significant population of Chinese race to cater to their palettes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will make use of data analytics to create a model that aims to recommend the ideal location which addresses the 3 key criteria identified above: (1) number of existing restaurants (2) number of existing Chinese restaurants (3) population with high number of Chinese. The final recommendations will be tabled together to allow targeted stakeholders to weigh out the pros and cons before deciding on the final location. \n"
